Sequential implementation:		main.c
Pthread implementation:			p_main.c
Improved Pthread imp.n:			p2_main.c
Open MP implementaion:			omp_main.c


Run script: ./run
	Runs all implementations
Average script: ./srun 
	Runs all implementations 1000 times each and outputs average time. Must make in non verbose mode first.
Makefile instructions:

make  		->  make all three implementations in non-verbose  mode (show timing information only)
make verbose-> compile all three versions in verbose mode (show output and timing information)
make clean 	-> clean
